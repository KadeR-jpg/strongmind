# Strongmind assessment
I chose to use typescript as the main programming language, paired with Sveltekit for an easy templating tool.
I also utilized tailwindCSS to style things just because it is very quick and easy to make things look half-way decent.
I wanted it to be interactive and visually appealing so that is why i chose to make it a webpage, it also said full-stack assessment so it seemed fitting.
